#length of code DOES NOT determine the run time for the code

#Computer is slowwer if it gets warmer 
#Enviornment is important too, is there anythign else running in the background, then it will put this behind or later in the order 




L = ['a','b','c','d','e']


# Operations that we think about HOW LONG it'll take ;)
#add item
# check menbership
# remove item 
# index an item
# concatenation


# L.append(f) = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']
#Only one operation has to be done here 


L = ['a','b','c','d','e']

#has memory avaliable at the end but DOES NOt have any memory avaliable at the beginning

# L.insert(0,g) =  ['g','a','b','c','d','e'] #adds something at a specific place, and moves everything down 
L.pop() #removes the attribute at the end
